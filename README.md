[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/way_of_working-code_of_conduct-contributor_covenant.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/way_of_working-code_of_conduct-contributor_covenant)

This is a plugin for the [Way of Working](https://github.com/HealthDataInsight/way_of_working) framework. It uses the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) Code of Conduct v2.1

Using the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct benefits any community or project by setting clear expectations for acceptable behaviour and creating a safer and more inclusive environment for everyone involved. The Code of Conduct establishes guidelines for respectful communication and conduct and consequences for inappropriate behaviour.
